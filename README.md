## Python Scripting and modular coding of Perceptron.
In this code, we follow the modular coding to implement Perceptron for logic gates AND Gate and OR Gate
We know that Perceptron is only applicable for linear separable data not for non-linear separable data that's why we can't use it for xor Gate
